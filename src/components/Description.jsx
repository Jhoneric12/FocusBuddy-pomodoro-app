            The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that involves breaking work into intervals, typically 25 minutes long, separated by short breaks. Named after the Italian word for tomato (inspired by the kitchen timer used by its creator), the technique aims to enhance productivity and focus by providing a structured approach to work. By working in short bursts with scheduled breaks, individuals can maintain high levels of concentration, prevent burnout, and better manage distractions. After completing a Pomodoro (work interval), a short break of around 5 minutes is taken, and after every four Pomodoros, a longer break of 15-30 minutes is recommended. This method encourages a balance between work and rest, helping individuals to optimize their time and achieve their tasks more efficiently.
